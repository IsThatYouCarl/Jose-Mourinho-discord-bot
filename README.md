This project involves creating a Discord bot named "Jose Mourinho" with football-related functionalities. 

The project was initially inspired by the idea of a Jose Mourinho chatbot responding to specific messages with relevant gifs on my Discord server, so I can spam certain gifs at my friend when I dominate him in efootball 2024. 

It has expanded to include features such as:

1. Retrieving league table rankings for the top 5 European Leagues.
2. Gathering top scorer statistics for each league.
3. Providing information on upcoming matches for a specific team or within a competition/league (though somewhat limited by API key access restrictions).
